So, let’s start in the missions initServer.sqf-file, if you don’t have one, make one. Here we are going to write this code.
[] execVM "addActions.sqf";


Then in the addActions.sqf file, you past in these;
[
	cage_door,
	[
		"Unlock Door",
		{
			params ["_target", "_caller", "_actionId"];
			_items = itemsWithMagazines _caller;
			if ("Keys" in _items) 
			then {
				_target setVariable["bis_disabled_Door_1",0,true];
				"You unlocked the door." remoteExec ["hintSilent", _caller];
			};
		},
		[nil],
		12,
		true,
		true,
		"",
		"((_target getVariable 'bis_disabled_Door_1')!=0)",
		2,
		false,
		"door_1",
		""
	]
] remoteExec ["addAction", 0, cage_door];

[
	cage_door,
	[
		"Lock Door",
		{
			params ["_target", "_caller", "_actionId"];
			_items = itemsWithMagazines _caller;
			if ("Keys" in _items) 
			then {
				_target setVariable["bis_disabled_Door_1",1,true];
				"You locked the door." remoteExec ["hintSilent", _caller];
			};
		},
		[nil],
		12,
		true,
		true,
		"",
		"((_target getVariable 'bis_disabled_Door_1')!=1)",
		2,
		false,
		"door_1",
		""
	]
] remoteExec ["addAction", 0, cage_door];


Then you give the building you want to have a locked door on, this variable name, or you change it yourself;
cage_door

Then to get the selection, use this code;
_selections = selectionNames cage_door;
copyToClipboard str _selections;

But most of the time will the selection and the door number be the same, so you will get far with just using door_doornumber and bis_disabled_Door_doornumber.
