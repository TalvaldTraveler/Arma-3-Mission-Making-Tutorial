So, let’s start in the missions initServer.sqf-file, if you don’t have one, make one. Here we are going to write this code.
[] execVM "AddHoldActions.sqf";

Then in the AddHoldActions.sqf file, you past in these;
[
    plane1,
    "Plant Explosives",
    "\a3\ui_f_oldman\data\IGUI\Cfg\holdactions\destroy_ca.paa",
    "\a3\ui_f_oldman\data\IGUI\Cfg\holdactions\destroy_ca.paa",
    "(_this distance _target < 5) && (_this getVariable ['isBomBSpecialistPA', false])",
    "_this distance _target < 5",
    {},
    {},                                                    
    {_target setVariable ["BombPlanted", true, true];},
    {},
    [],
    10,
    0,
    true,
    false
] remoteExec ["BIS_fnc_holdActionAdd", 0, plane1];

The next we will do is to set up a trigger with the condition;
Plane1 getVariable ['BombPlanted', false]
Then in the On Activation, you fill it out with this;
PlaneBomb = createVehicle ["SatchelCharge_Remote_Ammo_Scripted", position plane1, [], 5, ""];
PlaneBomb attachTo [plane1, [0, 0, 1.5]];

Then set up a trigger who will be the zone to the airfield, just give it the name airfieldzone.

Then add a new trigger with these conditions;
plane1 getVariable ['BombPlanted', false] && !(plane1 inArea airfieldzone);
On Activation
PlaneBomb setDamage 1;
And boom!

Quick comment, if you just want some players to have the posibility to plant the bomb, place this in their init-field; this setVariable ['isBomBSpecialistPA', true, true];
If you want everyone to be able, just remove this part from the hold action code:
(_this getVariable ['isBomBSpecialistPA', false])
